# Serverless Functions

The project uses Cloudflare Workers for serverless functions:

## Functions

- [functions/_worker.ts](mdc:functions/_worker.ts) - Main worker entry point
- [functions/proxy.ts](mdc:functions/proxy.ts) - Proxy service for external resources

## Proxy Service

The proxy service in [functions/proxy.ts](mdc:functions/proxy.ts) handles:
- Proxying requests to allowed external domains (spectrumcomputing.co.uk and GitHub releases)
- Adding CORS headers to responses
- Caching responses for improved performance
- Security validation of target URLs

## Configuration

Cloudflare Workers configuration is defined in [wrangler.toml](mdc:wrangler.toml).
